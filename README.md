Extracting data from Spotify using Spotipy library

Spotify has a great API to give developers full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform. In this article we'll use this api to scrap a playlist and enrich it with interesting song data.
In honor of the 60th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart, on August 4, 2018, they created this special chart of the 600 biggest songs of all time. Besides extracting these 600 songs from the Billboard, we'll also pull interesting song data such as danceability, loudness, energy of each song.
We'll use Spotipy library for scraping data from Spotify. Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy we get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.
